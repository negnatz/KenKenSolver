How to Run:

1) Create a .txt file or use the provided puzzles and make sure the format is correct in the file.
2) Type in the filename of the intended puzzle into the openFile() function call in the ##Setup## section of the KenKen.py file
3) Open the KenKen file in Visual Studio code with python extension installed and run the KenKen.py file and the
   solutions will run and print the results as well as the number of iterations. You may also navigate to the folder in the terminal with
   python installed and run 'python KenKen.py' to see the output as well.
4) The puzzle solution and simple/best iterations will print first then the local search iterations(it may take a while, depending on puzzle size to see the iterations for the localSolution)
5) Change the .txt file to run another puzzle.
